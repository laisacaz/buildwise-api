* SVG object is optimized, removed inheritance SVGObject from PictureObject, then now SVG object is not drawn in memory for its display in vector exports
> Pay attention for working with the SVG object, it is now unlinked from the PictureObject, in consequence two properties are no longer available: Tile - which rendered the SVG image with vertical and horizontal repetition, and Image - which stored the image to be drawn. The denial of the last property allowed to draw an SVG object in vector exports without rendering the raster image in memory. You need to double-check your reports if you used the SVG object as an inheritance of a PictureObject.
